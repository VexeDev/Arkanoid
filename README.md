# **Arkanoid**

This was the first Unity tutorial I followed in a Game Dev class. The game is a basic Arkanoid clone with an added mechanic to spawn extra balls for the player. The game features basic menu controls. 

## **Controls:**
- Movement: A + D/Arrow Keys
- Pause: Escape

## **Instructions for Unity:**
1. Clone repo
2. Open Unity Hub
3. Select open
4. Select the Unity project folder in the directory of the clone
5. The project will be added to Unity hub
6. Select the project to open it (The project was last run in Unity version 2021.1.15f1)
